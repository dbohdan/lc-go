# Documentation

The files in this directory document lc-go and lc.

## Manual pages

- [`lc.orig.troff`](lc.orig.troff) contains the troff source file for the man page, with no changes from the original.
- [`lc-go.1`](lc-go.1) contains a refreshed version of the same man page, modernised to use `-mman` macros and lightly edited for clarity and concision.
  `man ./doc/lc-go.1` will render this on a modern Linux or BSD system.
- [`lc-go.1.md`](lc-go.1.md) is `lc-go.1` translated to Markdown.
