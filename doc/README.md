# Man pages for `lc(1)`

The files in this directory contain the man page sources for [lc](https://github.com/gdm85/lc).

* `lc.orig.troff` contains the troff source file for the man page, with no changes from the original.
* `lc.man` contains a refreshed version of the same man page, modernised to use `-mman` macros and lightly edited for clarity and concision. `man ./doc/lc.man` will render this on a modern Linux system.
