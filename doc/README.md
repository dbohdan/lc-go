# Man pages folc(1)

The files in this directory contain the man page sources for lc(1).

* `lc.orig.troff` contains the troff source file for the man page, with no changes from the original.
* `lc.1` contains a refreshed version of the same man page, modernised to use `-mman` macros and lightly edited for clarity and concision.
  `man ./doc/lc.1` will render this on a modern Linux or BSD system.
